  You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, 
  and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  
  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

  The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. 
  Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
