/*
  We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
  I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
  Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.
  You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):
  -1 : My number is lower
   1 : My number is higher
   0 : Congrats! You got it!
*/

// Forward declaration of guess API.
// @param num, your guess
// @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
int guess(int num);
