  We are given two sentences A and B.  (A sentence is a string of space separated words.  Each word consists only of lowercase letters.)
  A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.
  Return a list of all uncommon words. 
  You may return the list in any order.
